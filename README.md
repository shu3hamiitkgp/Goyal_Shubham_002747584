This project is a class assignment for the subject Application Engineering Design. In this application I have developed a healthcare system where certain patients can look for doctors in nearby hospitals. The doctors can eventually check the patients and create instances of checkups by adding their vital signs as encounters. 
The application has majorly 5 type of users - 

System Admin - Can access throughout the system, and has CRUD access for users, hospitals, and patients
Community Admin - has CRUD access for cities, communities and houses
Hospital Admin - has CRUD access for hospitals, doctors and patients
Patient - Can lookup doctors in nearby community hospitals also access their own personal information
Doctor - can create vitalsign encounters for patients under their perview.

The application uses basic data structures like list, ArrayList etc for data storage, no database is used

The below is a basic skeleton of the application, detailed class and sequence diagram can be found in Assignment 2 folder
